## Models
I started by designing the models:
- **Order**: Represents an order made by a customer. It contains properties such as `OrderId`, `CustomerId`, `OrderDate`, `TotalPrice`, and a collection of `OrderItems`. This model captures the essential details of an order and its relationship to the customer and items.
- **OrderItem**: Represents an individual item within an order. It includes properties such as `ProductId`, `Quantity`, `Price`, and a reference to the `Product`. This model links products to orders and includes quantity and price details.
- **Product**: Represents a product in the system. It includes properties such as `ProductId`, `Name`, and `Price`. This model provides the basic details required for any product.
- **Customer**: Represents a customer in the system. It includes properties such as `CustomerId`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Address`, and `PostalCode`. This model captures the customer's personal information and location details.

## Repository Pattern
The repository pattern was chosen to encapsulate the data access logic within repository classes. This approach provides a clean and straightforward API for the application to interact with the data layer, promoting separation of concerns and making the codebase more maintainable.

## Unit of Work
- **IUnitOfWork**: This interface provides a way to group one or more repositories to perform a transaction, ensuring that all database operations are executed within a single transaction. It includes properties for `Orders`, `Customers`, and `Products` repositories and a `CompleteAsync` method to save changes to the database.
- The Unit of Work pattern helps manage transactions and coordinate the work of multiple repositories. It ensures that a series of operations either all succeed or all fail, maintaining data integrity.

## CRUD Operations
I designed the methods to handle typical CRUD operations:
- **Order Handling**: Methods for creating, updating, retrieving by ID, retrieving all, and retrieving orders sorted by date. These methods ensure that all common operations related to orders can be performed. In update and create, I added basic product creation in case the product does not exist.
- **Customer Handling**: Methods for creating, updating, retrieving by ID, retrieving all, and removing customers. These methods ensure that all common operations related to customers can be performed.
- **Product Handling**: Method for creating and retrieving by ID. These methods are used by add and update order in case the product does not exist.
- By providing a full set of CRUD operations, the API ensures that it can handle all necessary interactions with the data models.

## Exception Handling
I assumed exception handling would be necessary:
- For each method, a basic specific catch block handles exceptions such as a general `Exception` to ensure that error messages are provided.

## Asynchronous Programming
I assumed asynchronous programming would be used:
- All methods and the `CompleteAsync` method in the `IUnitOfWork` interface are asynchronous. This assumption ensures that the API can handle I/O-bound operations efficiently, improving the scalability and responsiveness of the application.
- Asynchronous programming helps prevent blocking the main thread, making the application more responsive, especially under high load or when performing long-running operations.

## Additional Features
- I added some basic XML documentation to headers.
- I provided an `.http` file for basic testing.
- I added NUnit tests as requested.
